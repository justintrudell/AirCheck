# AirCheckTO
AircheckTO provides a simple intuitive web interface for displaying and logging crowd-sourced data. Users have the ability to fill out an easy-to-use form describing their symptoms, which is integrated with other data from users around the world. This data is then used to populate a heat map which displays weather and air quality at any location worldwide.
Users also have the ability to tweet at @AircheckAppsTO, including their symptoms and a hashtag of their current location. This information is then added to the existing data set and displayed on the heat map. The quality of air in major city centers worldwide is continuously monitored, and unsafe levels of pollutants are reported through the twitter account.

# Resources Used
To implement this solution, the team leveraged the Spark Web Framework alongside jQuery and a SQL database. We also used a variety of different API's, including weather and air quality from http://openweathermap.org/, as well as the Twitter API.
